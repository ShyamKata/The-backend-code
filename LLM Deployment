1. Setup Environment
A. Hardware Requirements
CPU/GPU: For faster processing, especially with larger models, a GPU is recommended.
RAM: Ensure you have enough RAM to handle model inference and document processing.
B. Software Requirements
Python: Ensure Python is installed. Python 3.6 or newer is typically preferred.
Dependencies: Install necessary libraries using pip or conda.

pip install torch transformers


2. Download and Load the Model
A. Choose a Model
For document summarization, GPT-2 or similar models are a good choice. If you need a smaller model for efficiency, consider models like DistilGPT-2 or GPT-Neo.

B. Load the Model
Here's a basic example using Hugging Face's transformers library with a GPT-2 model:

from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
model_name = 'gpt2'  # or 'distilgpt2' for a smaller model
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Move model to GPU if available
device = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'
model.to(device)


3. Document Processing
A. Upload Document
Ensure your application can handle file uploads and process various document formats (e.g., PDFs, DOCX). You might use libraries like PyMuPDF for PDFs or python-docx for DOCX files.

B. Extract Text
Extract text from documents and prepare it for summarization. For example, using PyMuPDF for PDFs:

import fitz  # PyMuPDF

def extract_text_from_pdf(file_path):
    text = ""
    doc = fitz.open(file_path)
    for page in doc:
        text += page.get_text()
    return text

4. Summarization
A. Prepare Text
Tokenize and prepare the text for the model. GPT-2 is typically used for generation, so you might need to customize the prompt for summarization.

def generate_summary(text, max_length=200):
    inputs = tokenizer.encode(text, return_tensors='pt').to(device)
    summary_ids = model.generate(inputs, max_length=max_length, num_beams=4, early_stopping=True)
    summary = tokenizer.decode(summary_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return summary

B. Generate Summary
Process the extracted text to generate a summary:

document_text = extract_text_from_pdf('path_to_document.pdf')
summary = generate_summary(document_text)
print(summary)
